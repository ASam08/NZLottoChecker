Use to check NZ lotto results, compare to your numbers, and tell you your winnings via HTTP POST request

The first time run, you will be asked to enter your lotto numbers one by one, and for the URL to post to. 
These will save as local .txt files in the directory the code is run from.
If you need to change these at all, edit either the "lottonumbers.txt" or "posturl.txt" files.
